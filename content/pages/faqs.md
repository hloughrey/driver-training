          ### Vehicle Safety Questions


          You'll be asked five vehicle safety questions, also known as "Show Me, Tell Me" questions. These will be drawn from the possible 28 questions as laid out by the government.

          ### Reversing Exercise


          You will be asked to complete a reversing exercise during your test. This tests your ability to maneuver the vehicle safely in confined spaces. The examiner will provide clear instructions on what is required.


          Our training includes extensive practice of the reversing maneuver in various conditions, with expert guidance on proper technique and spatial awareness. For additional visual guidance, search YouTube for "Category C1 Reverse".

          ### On The Road Assessment


          The driving test is designed to assess your abilities when driving on a variety of different road and traffic conditions. Pre-defined test routes are created to ensure this and to make all driving tests fair, regardless of where you go during the on-road driving section. You'll be driving for a minimum of 50 minutes.


          During this section, you'll be evaluated on your general driving ability, including proper use of mirrors, signals, speed control, and road positioning. Our training prepares you for all possible road scenarios you might encounter.

          ### Independent Driving Section


          You will drive independently for around 10 minutes, following either road signs or a series of directions given by the examiner. This tests your ability to plan ahead and make decisions without constant instruction.


          This section isn't about testing your navigation skills - it's about assessing how you drive when making your own decisions. Our training helps you develop the confidence to drive independently while maintaining proper technique.

          ### Controlled Stops


          During the test you will be asked to pull up and park on the left, before then safely pulling away. This demonstrates your ability to perform these maneuvers safely and with proper observation.


          Our training ensures you master the techniques for safe stopping, proper observation, and smooth pulling away in various traffic conditions.
